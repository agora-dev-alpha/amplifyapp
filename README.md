Here, we will follow and take notes on making a small, full stack application
using AWS, React, \& GraphQL.

## Module 1: Deploy and Host a React App

### 1.1: Create a new react application.

We use the commands:
```
npx create-react-app amplifyapp
cd amplifyapp
npm start
```
npx is an alias for `npm exec` which essentially runs a command
from a local or remote npm package.

In this case, `create-react-package` is the package we're using.
It then asks you to install it in the runtime.

### 1.2 Initialize a github repository

Create your package in a directory as shown above,
then simply make it a github repository

### 1.3 Log into AWS Management Console

Basically go to the AWS Console, and open the amplify tool

### 1.4 Deploy

There are two options:
1. Develop
2. Deploy
Option #2 allows us to develop locally, and deploy as a github branch!
How easy is that!

Pretty much step through the prompts until the app begins to deploy.
It will then trigger and re-deploy every time you push to a specific branch!

### 1.5 The Code!
I'm seeing mostly JS and css scripts as well as an svg (data)

#### index.js 
Which I'm sure aligns with the layout (left panel?)

#### tests 

#### App.js 
looks like it have the primary logic
